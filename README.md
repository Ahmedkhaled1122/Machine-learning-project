###  Predict Titanic Passenger Survival | Interactive Machine Learning App

This project predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on features like age, gender, and class. It combines machine learning and a **user-friendly Streamlit GUI**, allowing anyone to interact with the model in real-time.

## About the Project üíª

This project explores the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using classic machine learning models. What makes this project unique is the development of a **Streamlit-powered graphical user interface (GUI)** that allows users to interact with the model dynamically and visualize predictions in a simple web app format.

**Key components of this project include:**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization.
- Feature engineering to create meaningful features.
- Model selection and training (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.).
- GUI creation using Streamlit for model interaction.

## Project Workflow üìö

The project follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Collection and Overview:** Load the Titanic dataset and inspect its structure and content.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and understand relationships between variables.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features like age groups, extracted titles, etc.

5. **Model Selection and Training:** Train different models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

6. **Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics:** Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and perform hyperparameter tuning.

7. **Conclusion and Results:** Summarize findings and identify impactful features and best-performing models.
